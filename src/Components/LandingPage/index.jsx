            <p>This app has been designed to remind booksellers of recommendations for both subscriptions and on the shop
            floor.  It is still in an early build and features will be added over the next few months but it is at a stage
            where it would be useful for feedback.  The app will also become more useful the more booksellers use it and
            add tags to books.
